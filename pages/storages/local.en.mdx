# Local Storage

### Overview

Local Storage is a storage that stores media files into the local file system.

### Option Data Type

The option data type for local storage is as follows:

```json
{
    "type": "local",
    "path": "/path/to/local/storage"
}
```

#### `type` Field [#type-field]

| Item      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Data Type | "local"     |
| Required  | ✅           |

The `type` field specifies the type of the storage. This value is used to distinguish from other storage types,
so only `local` can be used.

#### `path` Field [#path-field]

| Item      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Data Type | String      |
| Required  | ✅           |

The `path` field specifies the path of the storage. This path uses the path of the local file system. If the path does
not exist, it is automatically created when the program is first run.

You can use both relative and absolute paths. In the case of relative paths, it is based on the directory where
CabinetJS is executed.

### Example

```json
{
  "type": "local",
  "path": "/path/to/local/storage"
}
```

The above example creates a local storage in the `/path/to/local/storage` path.
