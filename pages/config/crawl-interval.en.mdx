# `crawlInterval` Field

| Item      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Data Type | Int, String |
| Required  | âœ…           |

### Overview

You can specify how often the crawling job will run with the `crawlInterval` field. The field value must be in the form
of a number or string value.

If the field is set to an integer value, the crawling interval is set in milliseconds. If the field is set to a string,
the crawling interval is set in `vercel/ms` [supported units](https://github.com/vercel/ms) or Cron expression.

CabinetJS starts crawling when the crawling interval is reached. If the crawling job is already running, CabinetJS
will not start crawling until the next crawling interval.

### Valid Values

The `crawlInterval` field accepts the following values.

- Integer value
- String value in `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h` units [(reference)](https://github.com/vercel/ms)
- Cron expression
